Bitcoin tracker

This is a web app using Node.js as the server and a single HTML page as the front end. The app is powered by CoinGecko API.

The HTML page has a form with two date pickers (to pick a desired date range), three radio buttons to pick the desired data, and a submit button. The data options are the longest bearish trend, day with the highest trading volume, and the best day to buy and sell to maximize profit. Pick a date range and press the submit button, and the answer will appear in the text field beneath the form.
